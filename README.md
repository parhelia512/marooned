![Game Screenshot](assets/screenshots/dungeon1.png)

**Marooned** is a 3D first person adventure game set in the 1700s pirate era on a island full of dinosaurs. Below the islands are dungeons crawling with skeletons, spiders, and worse. Armed with only a rusty sword and your trusty blunderbuss, make your way through the dungeons to fight the boss at the end of the demo.

2. Navigate to the repository:
```powershell
cd Marooned
```

3. Build the project with Make:

```

### Linux
#### Prerequisites
You must install git, make (or cmake), a c++ compiler and raylib 5.5. Example on Ubuntu-based distributions:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git make cmake gcc g++
sudo apt install build-essential libasound2-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev # Required for building raylib
git clone https://github.com/raysan5/raylib.git
cd raylib
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```
#### Install Steps
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jhyde927/Marooned.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository:
```bash
cd Marooned
```

3. Build the project with Make:
```bash
make
```
Or build with CMake:
```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
4. Run `Marooned` or `build/marooned` depending on how you built. The assets folder and all `.so`/`.a` files (if ran `make install`) must be in the same folder in which the executable is run.

It is also possible to create a full Linux build for distribution by running
```bash
./linux_build.sh
```
